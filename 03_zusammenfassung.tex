This document tries to show a possible way of estimating bandpass filter coefficients from a given impulse response in a semi-automatic fashion. This impulse response is assumed to be generated by striking a rigid body, and the resulting set of estimated coefficients are supposed to help a sound designer to develop sounds based on a physical body. Max/MSP is used for real time synthesis. Also Max/MSP in combination with Python/numpy is used for the analysis.
