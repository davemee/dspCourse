\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
Although many possible improvements and optimizations are obvious, the attempt showed that the approach of using Max/MSP and python for the given task is not only feasible, but also highly convenient. The initial problem could be solved here in a satisfying but not exhausting way. Although efficiency in the analysis process has been considered unimportant, the results deliver more than decent calculation time. Usability and ease of use could be achieved and the process of modeling a rigid body is definitely aided by the program, partly delivering a solid basis for synthesis in an automated manner.
